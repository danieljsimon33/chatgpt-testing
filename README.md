Pretty much what the title indicates.

Note to future self: make sure not to lose the contents of that .env file!

General note: most of the funcitonal code (at the time of writing) came from the [OpenAI docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/streaming-responses?api-mode=chat&lang=javascript)
